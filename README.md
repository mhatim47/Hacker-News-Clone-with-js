This project is a simple clone of the popular Hacker News website, built as part of a JavaScript course on Scribma. It demonstrates core web development concepts including client-side routing, dynamic rendering, and modular JavaScript architecture.

## Features
- View top stories from Hacker News
- Simple client-side routing (no page reloads)
- Modular code structure (separate files for routing, views, utilities)
- Responsive design with custom CSS
- Easy to extend and customize

## Project Structure
```
index.html         # Main HTML file
main.js            # Entry point for app logic
router.js          # Handles client-side routing
style.css          # Custom styles
images/            # Image assets
pages/stories.js   # Stories page logic
util/view.js       # Utility functions for rendering views
test.html          # Test/demo HTML file
```

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Browse stories and explore the app!

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand single-page application (SPA) basics
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling
- Learn modular JavaScript and code organization

## Credits
- Built for the Scribma JavaScript course
- Inspired by [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
